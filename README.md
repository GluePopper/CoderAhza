Yo! I'm Ahza 👋
Wassup fam? I’m Ahza, a dev who’s all about that tech life. I’m into coding and creating some cool projects, always on the grind to learn new things and level up.

Outside of coding, I’m lowkey obsessed with sportsand gaming. If you’re into tech, want to collab, or just wanna vibe, hit me up. I’m always down to chop it up about coding, ideas, or just geek out on random stuff. Let’s make something cool together! 💬
